* Preparing and preprocessing datasets: curation, cleaning, formatting, and prompt creation.
* Designing custom data workflows to improve downstream model performance.
* Conducting research through papers, articles, and benchmarks to guide experiments.
* Strengthening fundamentals by learning Python from scratch through books and practice.
* Preparing clear reports and documentation for experiments and results.
* Planning to expand into model creation and architecture design as the internship progresses.
