### **Role Overview**
**Data Science Intern** | *June 2024 – Aug 2024*

My internship at the Centre of Data Modelling, Analytics and Visualization (CODMAV) was focused on healthcare analytics, specifically leveraging machine learning for early disease detection.

### **Key Projects**
**Lung Cancer Risk Prediction System**
* [View GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sumukhacharya03/Lung-Cancer-ML)
* Led the development of a **Lung Cancer Risk Prediction System** for early-stage risk assessment.
* **Data Preperation:** Performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, including **Random Forest** based missing value imputation.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** I applied advanced feature selection techniques such as **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**, **BSO**, **RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)**, and **SelectKBest** to optimize the dataset for training.
* The final feature set was **validated** by a **doctor**.
* **Model Development:** Implemented and tuned multiple machine learning models including **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**, **SVM**, and **KNN**.
* **Results:** Developed an Ensemble Model that combined the strengths of individual classifiers, achieving a peak accuracy of **98.75%** and a recall of **96.25%** for the **RFE-selected features**.

### **Research & Publication**
* Conducted in-depth research on Lung Cancer markers and ML techniques.
* Co-authored a research paper titled *"Predictive Analytics for Early Lung Cancer Risk using Machine Learning,"* which was accepted and published in **IEEE Xplore**.
* [View Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11256225)
