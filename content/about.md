I’m a final-year Computer Science student at PES University and currently an AI Intern at Tvam Technologies. My work focuses on fine-tuning language models, and I’m deeply fascinated by how AI can be applied to solve meaningful real-world problems. 

As I grow in this field, I aim to advance from fine-tuning existing models to building my own. I’m always looking for opportunities to strengthen my skills, take on new challenges, and contribute to impactful projects. I also have a growing interest in Big Data and Database Systems, helping me build a strong and versatile technical foundation. Outside of technology, I enjoy capturing moments through photography and love the strategic challenge of chess.
